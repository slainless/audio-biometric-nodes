# Simple Audio Biometric System with ESP32

Built on top of PlatformIO and Uvicorn.

## Components

On microcontroller side, ESP32 are used to collect and send audio recording, and control the end peripheral.
The code is based on [Arduino ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/index.html).
INMP441 is used as recording peripheral.

The server itself is driven by Python. 
FastAPI and MQTT client, are running on Uvicorn lifecycle and will act as the server to process
the recording and send appropriate command or drop the invalid recording.

## Recording

The data generated by INMP441 is 24-bit left-justified MSB, so there is a bit preprocessing involved 
before building the WAV. Even before that, I2S must be setup to accomodate those bits per sample, 
so we are using 32 bits per sample in the configuration. 

Each sample needs to be shifted and then written to the buffer. The recording process is also not
that straightforward since the system is ran on top of bare ESP32 without PSRAM so it needs to write
to flash first before sending the audio.

## Audio Transmission

Since the audio is stored in flash, the upload process is also done in chunking fashion, 
reading and sending 512 bytes per transmission.

Some simple protocol is defined to allow this method of communication. 
So, the recorder will send chunks and the server will reassemble those chunks and do processing on it.
The server will obviously discard any partial or non-conforming packets.

## Audio Processing

For audio processing:
- Speechbrain model `speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb` to embed the audio
- OpenAI's Whisper model `base` to process transcription

## MQTT Payload Format

```
MSG_TYPE | 4B           | message type
ID_SIZE  | 1B           | identifier size (in bytes)
ID       | ${ID_SIZE}B  | identifier
PAYLOAD  | REMAINING    | payload
```

The remaining constraints can be seen at [protocol.h](./src/mqtt/protocol.h).
